# Alphabet Replacer Readme

###### replaceLetterWithPosition
takes in a string and replaces alphabet letters with numbers. Turns the input string into lower case and uses a stream to turn them into ascii and then re-order them and filter out non alphabet characters.
Then it creates a string and returns that string where each entry is separated by a single space.
